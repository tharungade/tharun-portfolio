                    I wish Indian parents give more freedom of choice to their children and let them take their own decisions after they turn majors. 
                    Not saying that they should let them do anything, but they should have an obligation of showing their point of view and why they think the thing their children trying to do might not work. 
                    The biggest mistake parents do, is no let their children discover by themself and let them fail - yes failure, Indian parents are more fearful of their children's failure than their own. 
                    They can only see a tangible failure but forget to see an intangible - their mistake which are part of success.
